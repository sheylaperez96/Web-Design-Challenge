# Unit 11 Homework: Web Visualization Dashboard

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! I used what I've learned about HTML and CSS to create a website featuring a previous [analysis](https://github.com/sheylaperez96/python-api-challenge) that I did on Python.

Check out my cool website [here](https://sheylaperez96.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/)!

## Materials
- The landing page html file is [index.html](/index.html).
- The other pages of the website are found inside the visualizations [folder](/visualizations/).
- The assets tab includes the [css](/assets/css/style.css) used to style the website and the [images](/assets/images/) used in the website.
- The resources file has the [csv](/Resources/cities.csv) file that includes all of the data used for plotting in this analysis, which is displayed in the "data" page on the website. It also includes a jupyter [notebook](/Resources/convertToHTML.ipynb) that was used to convert the csv file into html.
